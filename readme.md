# FCCBot (a famous croatian perosn confession bot)

This bot will help you confess your trubles and show your true feelings to a famous croatian person. So, you can have a nice chat with Mr. Zdravko (the bot's name). Zdravko can test your honesty and tell you how you feel by sending him a nice selfie of yourself. Good luck and chat fair! :)

### PREREQ:
- VS 2015
- download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) for the bot emulator
- download the [bot emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator) so you can test it locally
- enter the started localhost address / or the remote address where it is deployed and appended with `/api/messages` to the bot emulator and start chatting over the bot emulator

### IDEA / ABOUT:
- inception at our company's friday hackathon, just for fun, no *real-deal* thing... our goal was to build a bot, host it, make it public and make it use some "cognitive" services :)
- Zdravko has two main features or tasks if you wish. First, Zdravko can ask you a series of simple YES or NO questions and play a game of honesty with you. After each question you should get an audio response from Zdravko and in the end a result of analyzing your voice articulation to tell if you are telling the truth or lies mostly, i.e. are you a liar or not. Secondly, Zdravko can accept your selfie photo and tell you something about your current emotional state.
- finally we'd like to make different celebrity personalities that the bot would impersonate so you could choose different ones

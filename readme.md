# FCCBot (can tell you how you feel from your photo and say hi)

This bot will help you confess your troubles and show your true feelings. So, you can have a nice chat with Mr. Zdravko (the bot's name). Zdravko can have a very basic chat with you and tell you how you feel by sending him a nice selfie of yourself. Good luck and chat fair! :)

### PREREQ:
- VS 2015
- download and install [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) for the bot emulator
- download the [bot emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator) so you can test it locally
- enter the started localhost address / or the remote address where it is deployed and appended with `/api/messages` to the bot emulator and start chatting over the bot emulator

### IDEA / ABOUT:
- inception at our company's friday hackathon, just for fun, no *real-deal* thing... our goal was to build a bot, host it, make it public and make it use some "cognitive" services :)
- Zdravko can responde to some commands like help, commands, hi, hello and good bye / bye, and he can analyze your selfie photo and do a recognition of your emotions.
- the whole idea was to impersonate some famous croatian celebrity and you chat with him/her by confessing your most evil sins and sending the bot your photo. After the magical analysis the bot would tell you if you were honest and how to repent, and also respond to you with a familiar audio voice of the impersonated person you had a chat with.

# FCCBot (famous croatian confession bot)

This bot will help you confess your trubles to your favourite and famous Croatian person. For starters, the bot will impersonate one of Croatia's favourite soccer league persons, Mr. MamiÄ‡. You can have a nice chat with Zdravko over this bot. Good luck. :)

### PREREQ:
- VS 2015
- download the [bot emulator](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator)
- enter the started localhost address appended with `/api/messages` to the bot emulator and start chatting over the bot emulator

### IDEA / ABOUT:
- inception at our company's friday hackathon
- this chat bot will ask you a series of simple YES or NO questions and play a game of honesty with you. After each question you should get an audio response from Zdravko and in the end a result of analyzing your voice articulation to tell if you are telling the truth or lies mostly, i.e. are you a liar or not.
